# Mips_Single_Cycle

Building a MIPS simulator that has simple ISA, and optimized for concurrent parallel execution for performance. MIPS ISA defines 31 integer instructions and are categorized into I, R, J types and MIPS ISA defines 32 general purpose registers. Building a CPU simulator that takes MIPS executable binary as an input and emulates the operation in single-cycle MIPS.
